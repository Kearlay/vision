Computer Vision Projects
==========

This repository contains groups of scripts written or forked as a benchmark for 
the state-of-the-art computer vision application. Collaborated with researchers at Columbia University Medical Center.

Overview
--------

The goal of this project was to build machine learning and computer vision models to help automate the process of classification and ships identification in multispectral satellite images. In this project, I processed and analyzed high-resolution raster dataset, built convolutional neural network (CNN) models (Grayscale input and RGB input) and deployed it in AWS.

This project has used openly licensed Planet satellite images collected over the San Francisco Bay area, and provided by a Kaggle user
