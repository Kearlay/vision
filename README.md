Computer Vision Projects
==========

This repository contains groups of scripts written or forked as a benchmark for 
the state-of-the-art computer vision application. Collaborated with researchers at Columbia University Medical Center.

Overview
--------

Our directories consist of three different projects:

1. Deep-CNN: an attempt to apply transfer learning with pre-trained CNN sets to outperform OpenCV ready-made algorithms
2. Image-Caption: useful resources and benchmarks regarding image captioning
3. Medical-Vision: an application of computer vision to the medical imaging technology

Those data and benchmarks are available in public for the purpose of research and downloaded without any personal contact. Please contact the original publishers or writers if you would want to enquire about the license status. 

Dependencies
------------

- All code is written in Python 3.
- Some code depends on the 'numpy', 'matplotlib', or 'pandas' library
